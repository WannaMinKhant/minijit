MiniJIT

Contains code for the posts

  * Writine a basic x86-64 JIT compiler from scratch in stock Python

  * JIT compiling a tiny subset of Python to x86-64 from scratch â€” in Python
    https://csl.name/post/python-compiler/

You need a UNIX/POSIX system and an x86-64 compatible CPU. I've tested this on
Linux and macOS, using Python 2.7 and 3+

How to run
----------

The first one patches up some machine code and runs it at runtime

    $ python mj.py

The second one JIT compiles Python bytecode to machine code at runtime

    $ python tests.py

If you have the `capstone` module installed, it will display an in-memory
disassembly as well.

You can also run the decorator test. It defines a function like this

    import jitcompiler

    #...

    @jitcompiler.jit
    def foo(a, b):
        return a*a - b*b

On the first *call* to `foo`, it will be compiled to native code and swap out
the original Python function. It treats all arguments as signed 64-bit
integers. If you have the Capstone module installed, it will also print a
disassembly. To run:

    $ python test-decorator.py
    Definition point of foo

    Installing JIT for <function foo at 0x7ff583c905f0>

    Calling foo

    JIT-compiling <function foo at 0x7ff583c905f0>
    Installed native code for <function foo at 0x7ff583c905f0>
    Calling function <CFunctionType object at 0x7ff583cde600>
    foo(1, 2) => -3
    Calling function <CFunctionType object at 0x7ff583cde600>
    foo(2, 3) => -5

    Disassembly of foo

    0x7ff583e6d000 48 89 fb       mov rbx, rdi
    0x7ff583e6d003 48 89 f8       mov rax, rdi
    0x7ff583e6d006 48 f af c3     imul rax, rbx
    0x7ff583e6d00a 50             push rax
    0x7ff583e6d00b 48 89 f3       mov rbx, rsi
    0x7ff583e6d00e 48 89 f0       mov rax, rsi
    0x7ff583e6d011 48 f af c3     imul rax, rbx
    0x7ff583e6d015 48 89 c3       mov rbx, rax
    0x7ff583e6d018 58             pop rax
    0x7ff583e6d019 48 29 d8       sub rax, rbx
    0x7ff583e6d01c c3             ret
